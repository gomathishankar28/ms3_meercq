# **Introduction**

MeerCQ gathers recommendations shared in public conversations on social media. It aims to create contact listings for
 recommended pros, so that the customers can easily see referrals from across social media, in one handy location.
 Customers can find a professional to contact for small jobs in and around the house.

The reason to promote this business model is because when there is a problem with any of the service at home,
it is very difficult to find an appropriate contact on time. Users refer to google and find some available contact which will not ensure 
a reliable service. MeerCQ aims at collecting the details and contacts  for such services based on experience from other users which 
ensures a reliable service.

The site enables the registered users to create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) contacts. The site also provides a platform to share
the user reviews for each contact, based on which the customers can choose a best contact professional from the list of available contacts.
